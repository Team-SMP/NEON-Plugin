# NEON Plugin

The NEON Plugin is a custom Minecraft plugin that is designed to run on the Team SMP.

## Forking

Feel free to fork this repo, as long as you adhere to the GNU GPL 3.o licence. 
If you do decide to use a fork, you will probably need to adjust some parts of 
the code as most of it is, again, intended to run on the Team SMP. I haven't 
added config - _yet_ - but I'm planning to add it soon to adjust values currently 
hard-coded (for example, coordinates, messages, etc.).
